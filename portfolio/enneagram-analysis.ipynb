    "## Key takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "### Takeaway one: Ego-focused types believe the enneagram is accurate\n",
    "\n",
    "If we compare the qualities between types with the highest and lowest perceived accuracy scores, we learn that types that exhibit more selfishness are most likely to perceive their description as accurate. \n",
    "\n",
    "Eights are the most dominant and strong-willed of enneagram types. Threes are the \"go getters\" of the enneagram and four the romantics. These are three very different types but they all show a strong degree of focus on self and desire to get their needs met.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's possible that these types like their description because a those descriptions are widely celebrated (which brings us to our next takeaway).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Takeaway two: More overlooked types agree less with their type description\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we can turn to those types that are least likely to perceive their enenagram as accurate: fives, sixes and twos. At first glance, these three types have very little in common. Fives are the thinkers, sixes the \"go down with the ship\" loyalists and twos the helpers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of personality, what these types have in common is they represent qualities that are needed in society but are often overlooked. For example, the two \"the Helper\" takes care of others. This type of emotional labor, though badly-needed, is often unseen. \n",
    "\n",
    "When these types read their description, perhaps it's a reminder of the parts of themselves are are unrecognized by society and, in an effort to distance themselves from that self, they perceive it as less accurate. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Takeaway three: Delivery of self-help resources should be subjective\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to personality tests, before communicating the results, it's important to take a step back and consider how the person receiving the personality test will understand the results. For example, an enneagram who is more likely to perceive the results positively may need to consider how the dark side of their type is also relevant and vice-versa. \n",
    "\n",
    "While this might seem like common sense, subjectivity is not always a framework for approaches to mental health. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implications\n",
    "\n",
    "The enneagram provides us with opportunity to understand the relationship between self-improvement and personality.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Analysis about whether or not the enneagram is a useful measure of personality\n",
    "- Compare the enneagram to other personality tests in terms of perceived accuracy (for example, Myer's Briggs)\n",
    "- Consider how mood impacts the likelihood of accepting/rejecting personality assessment"
