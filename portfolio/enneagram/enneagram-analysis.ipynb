    "In this analysis, I'll explore the relationship between an individual's enneagram and the likelihood that they agree with their type's description. \n",
    "\n",
    "The major assumption here is that people are more likely to accept information they perceive as good and reject information they perceive as bad.  \n",

    "I'll consider the reasons why different types agree (or disagree) with their enneagram type description what this says about the personality traits we value the most. I'll also discuss opportunities for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "I used Python (pandas, seaborn, pandasql). For a Jupyter Notebook with my code, [go here](https://github.com/The-Rebeckoning/data-science/blob/main/portfolio/enneagram-analysis.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you'd like to take the test, [here's a free one I like](https://www.eclecticenergies.com/enneagram/test). If you're inspired by my analysis and looking to spend a little bit of money, I'd recommend the test from the [Enneagram Institute](https://tests.enneagraminstitute.com/orders/create). \n",

    "Last, for the purposes of this assessment, I'm making assumptions that the enneagram is an accurate assessment of personality. I'll explore the possibility that this is not the case in the last section."

    "\n",
    "The enneagram is a personality test that consists of nine basic types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every person has a basic type that represents their core personality. There's debate about how people come to develop their type (ie nature versus nurture) but what's important is that, once formed, it doesn't change. \n",

    "    The Rational, Idealistic Type: Principled, Purposeful, Self-Controlled, and Perfectionistic\n",

    "    4 THE INDIVIDUALIST\n",
    "    The Sensitive, Withdrawn Type: Expressive, Dramatic, Self-Absorbed, and Temperamental\n",

    "    5 THE INVESTIGATOR\n",
    "    The Intense, Cerebral Type: Perceptive, Innovative, Secretive, and Isolated\n",

    "## Key takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "### Takeaway one: We value people who value themselves. \n",
    "\n",
    "If we compare the qualities between types with the highest and lowest perceived accuracy scores, we learn that types that exhibit more selfishness perceive their description as accurate. \n",
    "\n",
    "Eights are the most dominant and strong-willed of enneagram types. Threes are the \"go getters\" of the enneagram and four the romantics. These are three very different types but they all show a strong degree of focus on self and desire to get their needs met.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's possible that these types like their description because they're widely celebrated (which brings us to our next takeaway).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Takeaway two: Overlooked traits are valued less. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we can turn to those types that are least likely to perceive their enneagram as accurate: fives, sixes and twos. At first glance, these three types have very little in common. Fives are the thinkers, sixes the \"go down with the ship\" loyalists and twos the helpers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of personality, what these types have in common is they represent qualities that are needed in society but are often overlooked. For example, the two \"the Helper\" takes care of others. This type of emotional labor, though badly-needed, is often unseen. \n",
    "\n",
    "When these types read their description, perhaps it's a reminder of the parts of themselves are are unrecognized by society and, in an effort to distance themselves from that self, they perceive it as less accurate. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Takeaway three: The delivery of personality assessments should be subjective.\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to personality tests, before communicating the results, it's important to take a step back and consider how the person receiving the personality test will understand that assessment. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, an enneagram who is more likely to perceive the results positively may need to consider how the dark side of their type is also relevant and vice-versa. Feedback and recommendations for self-development should also reflect an individual dark side and sense of self. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The enneagram is a useful framework for individuals to better understand themselves and how they relate to others. My analysis shows that certain types agree more with their type descriptions whereas others are less sure. This variance might indicate that society as a whole values traits of those who look out for their own interests. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's some topics for additional exploration:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Analysis about whether or not the enneagram is a useful measure of personality\n",
    "- Compare the enneagram to other personality tests in terms of perceived accuracy (for example, Myer's Briggs)\n",
    "- Consider how mood impacts the likelihood of accepting/rejecting personality assessment"
