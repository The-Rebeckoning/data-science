## Histogram

A histogram is a plot that lets you discover, and show, the underlying frequency distribution (shape) of a set of continuous data. To construct a histogram from a continuous variable you first need to split the data into intervals, called bins. 

This allows the inspection of the data for its underlying distribution (e.g., normal distribution), outliers, skewness, etc. An example of a histogram, and the raw data it was constructed from, is shown below:

### How to describe a histogram


- Shape - overall appearance of histogram. Can be symmetrical, bell-shaped, left or right skewed, unimodal or bimodal 
- Center- mean or median
- Spread- How far data spreads. Range (max-minimum)
- Interquartile Range (IQR), standard deviation, variance
- Outliers- data points that fall far from the bulk of the data 


### What is the difference between a bar chart and a histogram?

The major difference is that a histogram is only used to plot the frequency of score occurrences in a continuous data set that has been divided into classes, called bins. Bar charts, on the other hand, can be used for a great deal of other types of variables including ordinal and nominal data sets.


## Boxplot


In descriptive statistics, a box plot or boxplot is a method for graphically demonstrating the locality, spread and skewness groups of numerical data through their quartiles. Used to show the range in values but doesn't provide info about the shape of the data.

### How to describe a boxplot

- Symmetric or not symmetric


# Multivariate Data Analysis

Multivariate analysis is a Statistical procedure for analysis of data involving more than one type of measurement or observation. It may also mean solving problems where more than one dependent variable is analyzed simultaneously with other variables.

There are three categories of analysis to be aware of:

- Univariate analysis, which looks at just one variable
- Bivariate analysis, which analyzes two variables
- Multivariate analysis, which looks at more than two variables


## Scatter plot

A scatter plot (aka scatter chart, scatter graph) uses dots to represent values for two different numeric variables. The position of each dot on the horizontal and vertical axis indicates values for an individual data point. Scatter plots are used to observe relationships between variables.

### Describing association 

### Type

- Linear association: pattern is a line
- Quadratic association: the pattern is parabolic (goes up and down)
- No association: there is no pattern

#### Direction

- Positive linear association: when x increases, y increases
- Negative linear association: when x decreases, so does y

#### Strength

- Weak linear association: points are largely scattered across a line
- Moderate linear association: points are partially scattered across a line
- Strong linear association: points are minimally scattered across a line


## Correlation 

Correlation or dependence is any statistical relationship, whether causal or not, between two random variables or bivariate data. In the broadest sense correlation is any statistical association, though it actually refers to the degree to which a pair of variables are linearly related. Wikipedia

### Correlation Coefficient

- Correlation coefficients are used to measure the strength of the relationship between two variables.
- Pearson correlation is the one most commonly used in statistics. This measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables.
- Values always range between -1 (strong negative relationship) and +1 (strong positive relationship). Values at or close to zero imply a weak or no linear relationship.
- Correlation coefficient values less than +0.8 or greater than -0.8 are not considered significant.
