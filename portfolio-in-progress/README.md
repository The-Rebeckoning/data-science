Context
I was interested in learning the growing trend of what dating apps are used for in India over the years.

Content
The data is from 2017-2022. I acquired the data using googleplayscraper from google playstore online. The data I received was more than just the column shown here but were unnecessary.

Inspiration
Are dating apps being downloaded more and more over the years? Won't get a close estimate of it using this data but will be able to still have a relative idea.
Which app has more favorable responses? Have those favorable responses stayed consistent through the years or have they increased/decreased? Does the first question change if we consider the last two years as the appropriate timeline to consider the favorability of one of the considered apps?
What are the common issues for those who rate the app below 3/5?
Do users find relationships? Do people find what they are looking for? (hard to answer using text analytics? maybe, but it is an interesting and crucial question)
User enthusiasm over the app is linked to their rating?
Are top rated reviews being found more useful to other users/potential users or the reverse?
Any common user of the three apps? Which app they favor? Which app stands in favor in case there are common users across the three?
