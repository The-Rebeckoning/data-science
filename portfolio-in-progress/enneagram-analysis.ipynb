    "In this analysis, I'll use enneagram data to form conclusions about which personality traits are most socially desirable.  \n",
    "\n",
    "My hypothesis is that people are more likely to believe their enneagram type accurately describes their personality if they like the traits associated with that type. On the flipside, people are more likely to say their type is innaccurate if they don't like that type's description. \n",
    "\n",
    "The underlying assumption here is that people protect their sense of self by embracing information that makes them feel good and rejecting information that makes them feel bad. Therefore, people are more likely to believe an enneagram type description is accurate if that type has valuable or attractive qualities. \n",

    "I've taken many personality tests throughout my life. Of the ones I've taken, the enneagram is hands down the most accurate. \n",
    "\n",
    "The nitty gritty simplified version is that every person has a basic type that represents their core personality. There's debate about how people come to develop their type (ie nature versus nurture) but what's important is that, once formed, it doesn't change. \n",
    "\n",
    "You are who are you but who you are at your best and your worst matters too- which the enneagram also accounts for. Each type shows certain behaviors when they're at their best (\"growth\") and  worst (\"stress\"). \n",
