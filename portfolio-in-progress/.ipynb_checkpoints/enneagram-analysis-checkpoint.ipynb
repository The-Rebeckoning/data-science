    "I've taken many personality tests throughout my life. Of the ones I've taken, the enneagram is hands down the most accurate. \n",
    "\n",
    "The nitty gritty simplified version is that every person has a basic type that represents their core personality. There's debate about how people come to develop their type (ie nature versus nurture) but what's important is that, once formed, it doesn't change. \n",
    "\n",
    "You are who are you but who you are at your best and your worst matters too- which the enneagram also accounts for. Each type shows certain behaviors when they're at their best (\"growth\") and  worst (\"stress\"). \n",
    "\n",
    "The types are organized into three centers: gut, head, and heart. The center describes the dominant emotions of that type. \n",

    "Gut enenagram types are most likley to feel anger/rage and instinctively act on those feelings (but not neccesarily consciouly). They deal with anger/rage. \n",

    "Heart types are most likely to feel things deeply and act on those emotions. They struggle with feelings of shame.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Head: Types Five, Six and Seven\n",

    "Head types are thinking types and respond based on what their minds tell them to do.  They are most likely to be plagued by fear/anxiety.\n",

    "\n",

    "Every type has certain tendencies and, depending on whether they're in a good place or a bad place, they sometimes assume the traits of another type. For example, as a three, when I'm at my best I can seem like a healthy six and at my worst an unhealthy nine.\n",
